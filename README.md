Study Cards
Study Cards is a web application that allows you to create cards to write down concepts and notes while you are studying. 
The application was developed using React, Node (Express), TypeScript, and MongoDB for the backend, and HTML and CSS for the front end.

The application allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the cards, enabling you to add new cards, read the content of 
existing cards, update the content of cards, and delete cards that you no longer need.

During the development of this application, I learned a lot about endpoints, mongoose, routes, callbacks, project structuration, and React hooks.
I also used Postman to test the application and ensure that it was functioning correctly.

The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express, and it uses MongoDB as the database. Mongoose is used to define the schema for 
the data, and endpoints are created to handle the CRUD operations.

The front end of the application is built using React, and it uses HTML and CSS for the structure and styling. React hooks are used to manage state 
and make the application more responsive and interactive.

Overall, the Study Cards application is a useful tool for anyone who wants to take notes and organize their thoughts while they are studying. 
The CRUD functionality makes it easy to add, edit, and delete cards, and the React-based front end provides a smooth and intuitive user experience.
